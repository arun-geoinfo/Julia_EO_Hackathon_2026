# Ocean Internal Waves Detection Hackathon

## Quick Start
1. Check the Data/ folder for input files
2. Run scripts from Scripts/ folder
3. Work on challenges in Tier1_DataFix/ and Tier2_Optimization/

## 🎯 Challenge Overview
This hackathon focuses on optimizing satellite imagery classification for ocean internal wave detection.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `Data/` - Input data (images, labels, model)
- `Scripts/` - Julia scripts organized by function
- `Tier1_DataFix/` - Work on data alignment issues
- `Tier2_Optimization/` - Work on performance improvements
- `Reference_Solutions/` - Reference implementations

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Explore `Scripts/Diagnostics/` to understand the data issues
2. Fix data alignment in `Tier1_DataFix/`
3. Optimize performance in `Tier2_Optimization/`

## 💾 Data Files
Large data files (images, model) are available separately. Contact organizers for download links.

The repository contains:
- All Julia scripts
- Labels (train.csv, test.csv)  
- Problem statement
- Reference solutions
